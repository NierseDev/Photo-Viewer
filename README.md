# Photo_Selecter_UI
Fun project - Simple Python UI to choose photos

This is a TKinter based simple UI to select and sort out photos from a given folder. This is particulary helpful when we need to choose multiple images from a huge number of photos inside a folder. It becomes tiresome to select manually by just looking at the thumbnails of the images. Also keeping track of the pre-selected images is a challenge. To help with that, this UI will display the images and provide options to select/de-select images. The selected ones will be watermarked with "SELECTED" tag on revisiting.
All the selected photos will be copied into a new "Select" folder inside the main folder.
